3D Genetics Simulator is an interactive learning app built with React and Three.js that helps users understand genetics through visual simulation. It shows a 3D DNA double helix, lets you create two parent organisms, and simulates inheritance to produce offspring with realistic traits. You can explore mutations, sex linked genes, and common genetic disorders while seeing results through organism visuals and Punnett Squares. The project is designed as an educational tool with tooltips, a guided tutorial, sound effects, dark mode, and accessibility options, and it works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
